## Info
Arm was my finals project at highschool.After graduating played a bit with it and made some upgrades.Also  made 
a second arm with potentiometers to do teach functions.

## Code
Code can be used for any 5 dof robot arm if you follow wiring instructions.


Lost almost all of the stl files , and i am shure there are much better arms on internet you can build.
